        I've been programming since 2016 and would call myself a full stack web developer.
        I work with the MEAN stack with Angular 5 on the front end, but I also know AngularJS.
        Along side web developemnt, I've learned and built my skills as a digial marketer, focusing on building social followings,
        SEO, ecommerce, and traffic generation though Google Adwords, Facebook and Instergram Ads.
